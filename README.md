EE273 ToDo Manager

#project description
Create a tool to track all the pieces of work and deadlines you have to manage across
your life. Add todos, with the ability to view by context (e.g. by subject, or if they can only
be completed in certain locations like at-uni, in-town, at-home). Schedule tasks, and add
deadlines and reminders. Could be augmented with dependencies (i.e. a ‘project’ cannot
be complete if any of the subtasks are not marked complete). Show upcoming tasks.
